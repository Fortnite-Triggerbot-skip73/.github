## 🚀 What is a Fortnite Triggerbot?

Triggerbot is a smart aim enhancement tool that automatically shoots when an opponent enters your crosshair. Unlike aimbot (which locks on), triggerbot lets *you* aim naturally — but fires with god-tier precision. It’s the lowkey cheat that looks legit AF but still wrecks lobbies 💥

Perfect for:

* **Peek battles** – shoot faster than humanly possible
* **Snipers** – hit perfect shots without reacting
* **Shotguns** – insta-fire when they pop out
* **Legit playstyle** – doesn’t look sus on replay
